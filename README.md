# Steganography-Py
This is a project that I have been working on based hiding information in a photo

IMPORTANT
*Must download python library called: Pillow
  -Pillow allows us to get and manipulate the data in a picture
*Must look up the code and fix the directories (FUTURE UPDATE WILL FIX THAT)
*Must place the original photo in the same directory as which the code is

Output will be named result.png enjoy! :D
